    to compile and store .class files in seperate folder

javac -d <folder-of-classfiles> <filename>.java
    javac -d classfiles helloworld.java

java -cp <folder-of-classfiles> <folder>.java

    java -cp classfiles helloworld

    ------ Having Package -- >>> Compile Same --->>>  Run like
    java -cp <folder-of-classfiles> <package-name>.<filename>
    
        java -cp classfiles Abstraction.Abstraction

java <filename>.java
        runs the java file directly without creating class files

java file name has to be same as of the public class name

file_name = helo_world

public class helo_world{
    //  the main method in the code has to be public to allow JVM to be able to access the main method form outside the class to start program execution 

    public static void main(String[] args){
        //code
    }
}

we can name the java file anything if it does not have a public class
